# Unsupervised Learning of Image Segmentation

This is a renewed implementation of the one contained in:

Wonjik Kim\*, Asako Kanezaki\*, and Masayuki Tanaka.
**Unsupervised Learning of Image Segmentation Based on Differentiable Feature Clustering.** 
*IEEE Transactions on Image Processing*, accepted, 2020.
([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09990))

I have made sure that, with respect to original repository, the new code is documented, easier to read and to mantain. To get started, copy a (possibly small) colour image inside the input directory. 

Then, run the script with

`python main.py <FILENAME>`
